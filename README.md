Project Summary:         
Successfully implemented three distributors using Jade library for behavioral simulation. Users can seamlessly launch their CFP to determine the best repair coffee.
This project demonstrates effective communication between UserAgent and RepairCoffeeAgent but is still pending completion.
Existing functionality allows users to explore part identification scenarios and make decisions based on repairing dates
Future improvements aim to improve realism by perfecting the repair coffee agent and integrating choices between  repairing and buying new products. 
The project in its current form provides a solid foundation for further development and improvement.
